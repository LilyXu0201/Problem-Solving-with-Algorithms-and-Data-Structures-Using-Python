# CHAPTER SIX TREES AND TREE ALGORITHMS

## 6.1 Objectives
- To understand what a tree data structure is and how it is used.
- To see how trees can be used to implement a map data structure. • To implement trees using a list.
- To implement trees using classes and references.
- To implement trees as a recursive data structure.
- To implement a priority queue using a heap.

## 6.2 Examples Of Trees
Now that we have studied linear data structures like stacks and queues and have some experi- ence with recursion, we will look at a common data structure called the tree. Trees are used in many areas of computer science, including operating systems, graphics, database systems, and computer networking. Tree data structures have many things in common with their botanical cousins. A tree data structure has a root, branches, and leaves. The difference between a tree in nature and a tree in computer science is that a tree data structure has its root at the top and its leaves on the bottom.  

Notice that you can start at the top of the tree and follow a path made of circles and arrows all the way to the bottom. At each level of the tree we might ask ourselves a question and then follow the path that agrees with our answer. For example we might ask, “Is this animal a Chordate or an Arthropod?” If the answer is “Chordate” then we follow that path and ask, “Is this Chordate a Mammal?” If not, we are stuck (but only in this simplified example). When we are at the Mammal level we ask, “Is this Mammal a Primate or a Carnivore?” We can keep following paths until we get to the very bottom of the tree where we have the common name.  

A second property of trees is that all of the children of one node are independent of the children of another node. For example, the Genus Felis has the children Domestica and Leo. The Genus Musca also has a child named Domestica, but it is a different node and is independent of the Domestica child of Felis. This means that we can change the node that is the child of Musca without affecting the child of Felis.

A third property is that each leaf node is unique. We can specify a path from the root of the tree to a leaf that uniquely identifies each species in the animal kingdom; for example, Animalia ! Chordate ! Mammal ! Carnivora ! Felidae ! Felis ! Domestica.  

Another example of a tree structure that you probably use every day is a file system. In a file system, directories, or folders, are structured as a tree. Figure 6.2 illustrates a small part of a Unix file system hierarchy.  

The file system tree has much in common with the biological classification tree. You can follow a path from the root to any directory. That path will uniquely identify that subdirectory (and all the files in it). Another important property of trees, derived from their hierarchical nature, is that you can move entire sections of a tree (called a subtree) to a different position in the tree without affecting the lower levels of the hierarchy. For example, we could take the entire subtree staring with /etc/, detach etc/ from the root and reattach it under usr/. This would change the unique pathname to httpd from /etc/httpd to /usr/etc/httpd, but would not affect the contents or any children of the httpd directory.  

A final example of a tree is a web page. The following is an example of a simple web page written using HTML. Figure 6.3 shows the tree that corresponds to each of the HTML tags used to create the page.  

```html
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
    xml:lang="en" lang="en">
<head>
   <meta http-equiv="Content-Type"
        content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
   <title>simple</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>A simple web page</h1>
<ul>
   <li>List item one</li>
   <li>List item two</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="http://www.cs.luther.edu">Luther CS </a><h2>
</body>
